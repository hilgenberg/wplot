/**
 * Part of a WorkLayer. Distinguished from its siblings in the same layer by the data in its work lambda.
 * If the WorkLayer plows through some loop then one WorkUnit is typically some part of the loop where
 * i1 <= i < i2 and the units are more or less independent and can often run in parallel.
 * 
 * The execution lifecycle is like this:
 * -# The unit starts in State::TODO
 * -# The layer calls assign and state switches to State::ASSIGNED
 * -# WorkUnit::start is called which waits until all units that this one depends on are WorkUnit::done()
 * -# WorkLayer::work runs for the unit, passing thread_data (cf. Task class) of the thread that runs it
 * -# WorkUnit::finish sets state to State::DONE

/**
 * Typically one major step of an algorithm. Divided into an array of work units that run in parallel.
 * Layers are stacked on top of each other. The entire stack is the Task.
 *
 * Work layers can handle three types of dependencies between work units:
 * -# This layer needs the entire layer below to finish before it can run any work units
 * -# Every work unit needs its pendant on the layer below (and possible the neighbours of that unit) to finish
 *    before it starts running.
 * -# No work unit can run in parallel with its direct neighbours (or an entire range of neighbours)
 *
 * The work that a work layer does is passed as a std::function which should contain all needed data as well.
 *
 * Work units have two natural orderings: On the one hand they are elements of an array - call that index_order.
 * On the other hand they can be sorted by the neighbour dependencies: 0, 1+space, 2+2space, ..., wrapping around.
 * Call that work_order. This distinction is important for the internal bookkeeping and WorkLayer has private
 * methods to convert between the two orderings.
